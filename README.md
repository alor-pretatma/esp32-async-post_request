Using this project you can connect with server ***__asynchronously__***
This [AsyncHttp](https://github.com/alor-pretatma/esp32-async-request/tree/master/AsyncHttp) demonstrates how to post data using HttpClient asynchronously.
And [AsyncWiFiClient](https://github.com/alor-pretatma/esp32-async-request/tree/master/AsyncWiFiClient) demontrates how to get data using WiFiClient library.
As this project itself is an example, so i don't think there needs any more explaination.
Yet, if you face any problem.__Let Me Lnow__
